Installation
============

FusionCAT can be installed directly from its source repository using `pip`. It is highly recommended to perform the installation within a dedicated Python virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other packages.

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the project from GitHub to your local machine:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/FusionCAT.git
      cd FusionCAT

2. **Install with pip**

   Install the package in "editable" mode. This allows you to make changes to the source code and have them immediately reflected in your environment without needing to reinstall.

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -e .
